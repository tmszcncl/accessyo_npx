**Stop guessing why your users can't connect — see it from their network.**

## What is Accessyo?

Accessyo is a network debugging CLI that shows _why_ your users can't connect — not just that something is down.

> "Your server is fine. Your users still fail."

Current monitoring tools (UptimeRobot, Datadog) see your servers. They don't see:

- ISP-level issues (Orange, Vodafone, Comcast)
- VPN / corporate proxy problems
- DNS resolution failures
- TLS handshake errors
- CDN edge routing issues
- Browser-level blocks (CORS, extensions)

Accessyo does.

## Status

The CLI is in active development. Currently supports:

- Network context (public IP, country, DNS resolver)
- DNS resolution (A, AAAA, CNAME records, TTL, resolver)
- TCP connectivity check
- TLS handshake (protocol, cipher, certificate info + expiry, hostname match, HTTP/2 via ALPN)
- HTTP request (status, TTFB, redirects, IPv4/IPv6, browser UA comparison, CDN detection, WAF blocking, www/non-www canonical check, HSTS validation)
- Timings summary (per-check + total)
- Root cause diagnosis with actionable suggestions
- Batch mode — check multiple domains at once with per-domain warnings (HSTS, cert expiry, IPv6, slow response)

**Single domain** (full detailed output):

```
npx accessyo example.com
```

**Multiple domains** (compact summary + auto-details for failures):

```
npx accessyo example.com api.example.com cdn.example.com
```

**Options:**

```
--timeout <ms>   per-check timeout in milliseconds (default: 5000)
--json           output results as JSON
```

```
npx accessyo example.com --json
npx accessyo example.com --timeout 3000
```

```
  example.com        ✓ WORKING
  api.example.com    ✗ NOT WORKING (TLS)
  cdn.example.com    ✓ WORKING

────────────────────────────────────────

  1 working, 2 failing

  api.example.com

  ✗  TLS

     certificate has expired
  ...
```

Domains failing with the same error are grouped into a single debug block.
